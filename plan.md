## 1. Create the Main Ticket Generation Page

**File:** `src/app/page.tsx`

- **Purpose:** Main entry point with a form to collect player information and image upload
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Create a React component with form fields for:
    - Player Name (text input)
    - Image Upload (file input with preview)
  - Use react-hook-form for form validation and handling
  - Implement file upload with base64 conversion
  - Add form submission handler that calls the API
  - Display loading state during ticket generation
  - Show generated ticket after successful submission
- **UI/UX Considerations:**
  - Modern, clean design using Tailwind CSS
  - Responsive layout for mobile and desktop
  - File upload preview functionality
  - Error handling and validation messages

## 2. Create the Ticket Generation API Endpoint

**File:** `src/app/api/generate-ticket/route.ts`

- **Purpose:** Process form submission and generate ticket with serial number
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Create POST handler for Next.js 13 app router
  - Parse JSON request body (playerName, imageData)
  - Generate unique serial number using timestamp + random number
  - Validate input data
  - Return ticket data including:
    - Generated serial number
    - Player name
    - Image data
    - Event details
- **Serial Number Generation:**
  - Format: `VGE-${timestamp}-${randomNumber}` (e.g., VGE-1703123456-7891)
  - Ensure uniqueness using current timestamp + random component

## 3. Create Ticket Display Component

**File:** `src/components/TicketDisplay.tsx`

  - Include download/save functionality
- **Template Integration:**
  - Use user's ticket template as base image
  - Add serial number as text overlay using CSS positioning
  - Maintain ticket template design integrity
  - Ensure serial number is visible and readable

## 4. Create Layout and Styling

**File:** `src/app/layout.tsx`

- **Purpose:** Set up the main application layout
- **Implementation Steps:**
  - Configure Next.js app layout
  - Add Google Fonts for modern typography
  - Set up Tailwind CSS configuration
  - Add meta tags and page title
  - Ensure responsive design

  - Base64 conversion for API transmission
  - File size and type validation
- **Error Handling:**
  - Form validation errors
  - API error responses
  - Network error handling
- **User Experience:**
  - Loading states during processing

## Summary

The application will:
1. Collect player name and image upload through a modern form interface
2. Generate unique serial numbers automatically
3. Apply the serial number to the user's ticket template
4. Display the final ticket with all information
5. Provide a clean, modern user experience with proper error handling

The serial number will be overlaid on the ticket template at a random position as requested, and can be repositioned later as needed.
